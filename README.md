Alexa Peek
==========
I wanted to have some base code to quickly perform an analysis of the top listed Alexa websites if required.  However, I haven't thought of anything terribly interesting to analyse yet.  At the moment, it grabs the top 10 listed Alexa websites and prints out their META description.

It would prove a useful starting point for anyone wanting to scrape webpages for any reason, hence I've put it up here.

Requirements
------------
* Requires nodejs, CoffeeScript & phantomjs installed

Usage
-----
```bash
npm install
coffee alexa-peek.coffee
```
