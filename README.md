Alexa Peek
==========
I wanted to perform some HTML analysis of the top listed Alexa websites, but I haven't thought of anything terribly interesting to analyse yet.  At the moment, it grabs the top 10 listed Alexa websites and prints out their META description.

Requirements
------------
* Requires nodejs, CoffeeScript & phantomjs installed

Usage
-----
```bash
npm install
coffee alexa-peek.coffee
```
